# Complements and Duality

Duality operations map between vectors of complementary grades, revealing the deep symmetry between intrinsic and extrinsic descriptions of geometric objects.

## The Unit Pseudoscalar

In any $d$-dimensional space, the **unit pseudoscalar** serves as the fundamental reference element:

$$\mathbb{1} = \mathbf{e}_1 \wedge \mathbf{e}_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathbf{e}_d$$

This highest-grade element represents the oriented volume of the entire space and provides the algebraic foundation for all duality operations.

## Complement Operations

Complements map between grades $k$ and $(d - k)$ using only the **Levi-Civita symbol** — they are metric-independent.

### Right Complement

For a grade-$k$ k-vector $b$:

$$\bar{b}^{m_{k + 1} \ldots m_d} = b^{m_1 \ldots m_k} \, ε_{m_1 \ldots m_d}$$

### Left Complement

$$\underline{b}^{m_1 \ldots m_{d - k}} = ε_{m_1 \ldots m_d} \, b^{m_{d - k + 1} \ldots m_d}$$

### Orthogonality

Complements satisfy the fundamental orthogonality relationship:

$$u \wedge \overline{u} = \mathbb{1}$$

$$\underline{u} \wedge u = \mathbb{1}$$

A k-vector and its complement span the entire space with no overlap.

### Sign Relationship

$$\underline{u} = (-1)^{\text{grade}(u) \cdot \text{antigrade}(u)} \, \overline{u}$$

where antigrade $= d - $ grade.

### Involution Property

Complements are involutions — applying them twice returns the original:

$$\overline{\overline{u}} = u$$

$$\underline{\underline{u}} = u$$

## Geometric Interpretation

Consider a plane in 3D space. We can describe it in two equivalent ways.

**Intrinsically**: Two vectors spanning it produce a bivector $\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b}$.

**Extrinsically**: The perpendicular vector is its complement $\bar{\mathbf{p}}$.

The complement transforms between these descriptions. The relationship $\mathbf{p} \wedge \bar{\mathbf{p}} = \mathbb{1}$ ensures that the plane and its normal together span the full 3D space.

This generalizes naturally to higher dimensions. In 4D, a plane (bivector) has a 2D complement (also a bivector). In 5D, a plane has a 3D complement (trivector).

## The Hodge Dual

The **Hodge dual** is the metric-dependent counterpart to complements:

$$\star v = G(\bar{v})$$

where $G$ applies the metric to raise/lower indices. In components:

$$(\star v)^{m_{k + 1} \ldots m_d} = \frac{1}{k!} \, g^{m_{k + 1} n_{k + 1}} \cdots g^{m_d n_d} \, v^{m_1 \ldots m_k} \, ε_{m_1 \ldots m_d}$$

The distinction is important:
- **Complement**: Uses only Levi-Civita symbol (metric-independent)
- **Hodge dual**: Uses Levi-Civita and metric tensor (metric-dependent)

### Grade Mapping

$$\text{grade}(\star b) = d - \text{grade}(b)$$

### Double Hodge Dual

$$\star \star v = (-1)^{k(d - k)} \, \text{sgn}(g) \, v$$

where $\text{sgn}(g)$ is the sign of the metric determinant: $+1$ for Euclidean, $-1$ for Lorentzian.

### Examples by Dimension

**3D Euclidean:**
- Vector $v \xrightarrow{\star}$ bivector (perpendicular plane)
- Bivector $b \xrightarrow{\star}$ vector (perpendicular direction)
- Trivector $\xrightarrow{\star}$ scalar

**4D Euclidean:**
- Vector $\xrightarrow{\star}$ trivector
- Bivector $\xrightarrow{\star}$ bivector (self-dual structure)
- Trivector $\xrightarrow{\star}$ vector

The self-dual nature of bivectors in 4D creates rich structure — the 6-dimensional bivector space splits into 3D self-dual and anti-self-dual subspaces.

## Metric-Independent vs Metric-Dependent

Understanding which operations require the metric is essential:

**Metric-independent (work in any vector space):**
- Exterior product (wedge) $\wedge$
- Left and right complements
- Join operation (same as wedge)
- Meet operation (via complements)

**Metric-dependent (require inner product structure):**
- Interior product (contraction)
- Hodge dual
- Norms and normalization
- Orthogonal projection and rejection
- Distance calculations

## The Meet via Complements

The intersection (meet) of two subspaces can be computed using complements:

$$u \vee v = \overline{\left(\overline{u} \wedge \overline{v}\right)}$$

This duality formula converts intersection to a wedge product in the complement space.

## Applications

### Cross Product as Duality

The 3D cross product is the Hodge dual of the wedge product:

$$\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \star(\mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b})$$

This explains why the cross product only works in 3D — it requires the special coincidence that vectors and bivectors have the same dimension (both 3).

### Electromagnetic Duality

In electromagnetism, the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ are Hodge duals in spacetime. The Maxwell equations exhibit a duality symmetry under $\mathbf{E} \leftrightarrow \star\mathbf{B}$.
